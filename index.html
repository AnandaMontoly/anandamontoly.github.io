      <p>Hello, I'm Ananda and I'm a junior at <a href="https://www.smith.edu/">Smith College</a> in Northampton Massachusetts.
        I'm majoring in computer science and I have an as-of-yet undeclared minor in mathematics with a focus in statistics. I am interested in working as a
        data scientist or as a software engineer after graduation. I'm also interested in getting either a masters degree or a Ph.D.
        I love diving into a piece of code and solving problems. The process of untangling an error and finding exactly where the issue arises is one which
        I deeply enjoy.
        <br><br>
        In my free time, I am a member of several clubs at Smith.
      </p>
      <h2 id="coursework" class="section">Coursework</h2>
      <p>I've taken the following computer science and math coursework towards my major. Next semester, I am taking microprocessors, algorithms, and linear algebra.</p>

      <h2 id="experience" class="section">Experience</h2>
      My resume is available <a href="resume.pdf">here.</a> I have a background in data science with a focus in information retrieval topics.
      I've written websites, a Discord/Google calendar bot, Google spreadsheet scraper, NLP tools, and created many data visualizations.
      <h3 id="skills">Skills</h2>
        <p>
          I have the most experience with Javascript and Python for front/back-end development and data science tasks
          respectively, though I am a big fan of R. My favorite database to work with is SQLite, but I have experience with neo4j as well.
          I served as a webmaster for multiple organizations on campus, including making website which was used for the annual comic convention on campus.
          <br><br>
          I have frequently worked with Javascript/Node.js, Python, R, Java, SQL, and HTML/CSS.
          <br><br>
          I've used PHP, Cypher, and C#.
          <br><br>
          Outside of tech, I am a strong writer, researcher, and creative thinker. I have experience leading clubs on campus as well as running events as part of a team.
          Conversationally, I speak fluent English, proficient Spanish, and beginner's German.
        </p>
      <h2 id="writing" class="section">Writing</h2>
      <p>I am an avid writer in both my personal and professional life. One of the things I enjoy doing is writing about tech. My <a href="https://medium.com/@anandamontoly">Medium account</a>
      showcases some of my tech writing. One of my articles was selected for distribution in the programming tag by Medium curators.
      I've also had the privilege to work with several research groups at Smith College and Boise State University in the publication process.</p>
