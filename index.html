      <p>Hello! My name is Ananda and I'm a junior at <a href="https://www.smith.edu/">Smith College</a> in Northampton, Massachusetts.
        I'm majoring in computer science and statistical and data sciences.
        I love talking about information retrieval, data visualization, and human-computer interaction.
        <br><br>
        In my free time, I'm a CS department liaison, a member of the Caribeñe student association, the webmaster of Conbust, and the events chair for Smithies in CS. Next summer, I join Audible as a software engineering intern on the customer relationship management team.
      </p>
      <h2 id="coursework" class="section">Coursework</h2>
      <p>I've finished the following computer science and math coursework towards my majors. This J-term, I'm taking Research Design, and the semester after it, I take Calc 2 and Multiple Regression.
        I'm also working as a TA for Introduction to Computer Science and Computer Graphics and teaching a series of workshops on foundational CS skills for 30 intro CS students.</p>

      My resume is available <a href="resume.pdf">here.</a> I have a background in data science with a focus in information retrieval topics. My Github is linked <a href="https://github.com/AnandaMontoly">here</a>.
      In November, my team won an award at HackHolyoke 2020 for our use of CockroachDB, a distributed SQL database, which I set up for our backend. My team also won best use of DataStax Cassandra at HackUmass in December of 2020, for which I set up our API. I also developed our front-end in React.
      <h3 id="skills">Skills</h2>
        <p>
          I served as webmaster for multiple organizations on campus, including making a website which was used for the annual college comic convention.
          <br><br>
          I have the most experience with Javascript/Node.js, Python, R, Java, SQL, and HTML/CSS.
          <br><br>
          Outside of tech, I have experience leading clubs on campus as well as running events as part of a team.
