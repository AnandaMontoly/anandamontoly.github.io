      <p>Hello, I'm Ananda and I'm a junior at <a href="https://www.smith.edu/">Smith College</a> in Northampton Massachusetts.
        I'm majoring in computer science and I have an as-of-yet undeclared minor in mathematics with a focus in statistics. I am interested in working as a
        data scientist or as a software engineer after graduation. I'm also interested in getting either a masters degree or a Ph.D.
        I love diving into a piece of code and solving problems. The process of untangling an error and finding exactly where the issue arises is one which
        I deeply enjoy. Writing guides to tech and computer science is something else I deeply enjoy as well.
        <br><br>
        In my free time, I am an avid knitter, crafter, and reader. My favorite book is <i>The Left Hand of Darkness</i> by Ursula K. LeGuin.
