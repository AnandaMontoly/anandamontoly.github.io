      <p>Hello, I'm Ananda and I'm a junior at <a href="https://www.smith.edu/">Smith College</a> in Northampton Massachusetts.
        I'm majoring in computer science and I have an as-of-yet undeclared minor in mathematics with a focus in statistics. I am interested in working as a
        data scientist or as a software engineer after graduation. I'm also interested in getting either a masters degree or a Ph.D.
        I love diving into a piece of code and solving problems. The process of untangling an error and finding exactly where the issue arises is one which
        I deeply enjoy.
        <br><br>
        In my free time, I am a member of several clubs at Smith. If you're interested in contacting me, I encourage you to email me <a href="mailTo:amontoly@smith.edu">here.</a>
      </p>
      <h2 id="coursework" class="section">Coursework</h2>
      <p>I've taken the following computer science and math coursework towards my major. Next semester, I am taking microprocessors, algorithms, and linear algebra.</p>

      <h2 id="experience" class="section">Experience</h2>
      My resume is available <a href="resume.pdf">here.</a> I have a background in data science with a focus in information retrieval topics.
      I've written websites, a discord/Google calendar bot, Google spreadsheet scraper, NLP tools, and created many data visualizations. 
      <h3 id="skills">Skills</h2>
        <p>
          I am a programmer and developer who has worked in multiple languages, but I am most skilled with Javascript and Python for front/back-end development and data science tasks
          respectively, though I am a big fan of using tidyverse in R. My favorite database to work with is SQLite, though I have experience with neo4j as well.
          I served as a webmaster for multiple organizations on campus, including making website which was used for the annual comic convention on campus.
          <br><br>
          I feel comfortable with Javascript/Node.js, Python, R, Java, SQL, and HTML/CSS.
          <br><br>
          I've used PHP, Cypher, and C#, but not enough to develop proficiency yet.
          <br><br>
          Outside of tech, I am a strong writer, researcher, and problem solver. I have experience leading clubs on campus as well as running events as part of a team.
          Conversationally, I speak fluent English, proficient Spanish, and beginner's German.
        </p>
      <h2 id="writing" class="section">Writing</h2>
      I am an avid writer in both my personal and professional life. One of the things I enjoy doing is writing about tech. My <a href="https://medium.com/@anandamontoly">Medium account</a>
      showcases some of my tech writing. One of my articles was selected for distribution in the programming tag by Medium curators.
